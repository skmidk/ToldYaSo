# What this app does
This server allows posting to a database, retrieving data from it,
updating data in the database, and deleting data from the database.

# Technologies used

This client application utilizes express, mongoose, and mongodb

# unsolved problems
I would like to figure out how to update items with handlebars
 I also would like to add a comment feature!


# planning
I drew out an ERD to see how I would model things. I first worked on making my schema
then moved onto curl scripts, and finally took care of my routes for both the user and
the posts.
